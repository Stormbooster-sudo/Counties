  Counties is a tasks or events countdown timer desktop app that comes with a small widget, which floats on your screen for easier monitoring and remembering your tasks or events. This project is an improved and offline version of cloud Counties (https://github.com/Sahachat522/Project229), which is a project I work with my friends in Software-Defined Architecture class.
## Features
Countes provides the following features:
- Task/Event date countdown timer
- Overlay windows widget
- Support calendar view
- Drag and drop task or event
- Customize task or event on calendar
- Dark/Light mode support both app and widget
- Customize widget apparence
- Run on start-up

## How To Install
To clone and run this application command line:
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Stormbooster-sudo/Counties

# Go into the repository
$ cd Counties

# Install dependencies

# Run the app
$ npm start
```
**In some feature you need to build the app and install in your computer** by using this command line after cloning success:
```
# Build the app
$ npm run package-win
```
**After building success**, you will have a new folder "release-builds". Inside the folder "release-builds" will have a "**Counties-win32-x64**" folder, move that folder to your **Program Files** folder and always run the app (Counties.exe file inside Counties-win32-x64) with **addministrator mode**.

Or you can [download](https://github.com/Stormbooster-sudo/Counties/releases/download/v1.0.0/Counties-win32-x64.zip) app from release and extract the zip file into your **Program Files** folder
